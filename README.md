java-technical-test
===================

Core Java programming questions.  Primarily usage of the Java Collections API.

## Summary

Implement the method stubs in the JavaTest.java class, and write JUnit test methods to prove your implementation.  The first test is already written to get you started.

**Note: This test should be setup, completed and returned within 1.5hrs.  The quicker you can return it, the more credit you will receive.**

## Instructions if using Git and Maven:

- Clone this git repository and ensure tests execute:

    $ git clone https://github.com/chenery/java-technical-test.git
    $ cd java-technical-test/
    $ mvn test

- Complete the test class (You can use whatever IDE/editor you like).  See further instructions/comments inline.
- Return to paul@solidstategroup.com with the allowed time period.

## Instructions if NOT using Git and Maven:

- Create a new project in your IDE/editor.
- The JavaTest.java class is dependent on JUnit.  Download the JUnit jar file and place on your classpath (https://github.com/downloads/KentBeck/junit/junit-4.10.jar).
- Complete the test class.  See further instructions/comments inline.
