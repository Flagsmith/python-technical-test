Java programming questions.

## Instructions

1. Clone this git repository which contains a number of Java source files and open as a project in your editor of choice.
2. Answer the three questions listed below by providing the missing implementations.  Do NOT use 3rd party libraries.
3. Provide tests in your preferred style to support your solution.  You can use common test libraries such as junit and mockito.

In addition to a working solution, we will be looking for:

- Good coding style
- Use of comments - especially if you get stuck on a question
- Understanding of object orientation
- Understanding of concurrency issues that might arise

**Note: Please do not push your test answers back onto Github.**
